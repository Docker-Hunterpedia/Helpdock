# M1 Ticketing core

Status: in progress
Started: 2026-09-19
Owner: @Docker-Hunterpedia

## Scope
[PRD §4 · M1 Ticketing core](../planning/PRD.md#m1-ticketing-core). Depends on M0 (shipped 2026-09-19). Goal: agents can work tickets with Zoho-style discipline before any customer-facing surface exists.

Artboards on the design canvas for this milestone: `Admin · ticket view` (list + thread + details, from the foundations row), `Admin/Contacts`, `Admin/Contact`, `Admin/Ticketing` (settings tabs; the Statuses tab is drawn in full and the other tabs follow its list-plus-side-editor pattern). Screens not yet drawn must be requested before implementation (design-first rule).

## Exit criteria
Copied from the PRD, ticked as they are met.
- [ ] An agent can create, assign, reply to, note, tag, merge, split and close tickets in the admin UI, in English and Arabic.
- [ ] An Agent cannot see or open a ticket in another department, by list, by direct URL, by contact timeline, or by socket room.
- [ ] Every transition in DOMAIN-RULES §2.2 and each reopen policy value has a test.
- [ ] Every new tenant table has brand and, where applicable, department RLS policies and is covered by the negative test suite.
- [ ] Ticket list of 50k seeded tickets loads under 150 ms p95 under the D §14 conditions.

## Open questions
- Should a Team Leader read only their own departments' rows of the staff list and contact timeline? (raised in M0-06; DOMAIN-RULES §1.2 does not narrow it)
- `on_unassign` semantics on scope change: which tickets move when a role widens vs narrows (hook `onStaffScopeChanged` exists)
